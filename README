Plugin allows one to use Siri to search for whats currently playing on Colorado Springs Comcast digital cable.  It uses the zap2it.com guide listings. Thanks to rakusu https://github.com/rakusu/SiriProxy-TV-Control for the ideas that drove this.

requires nokogiri

gem install nokogiri


installation:

add 
    - name: 'Channels'
      git: 'git://github.com/Number1/siriproxy-channels.git'

to your config.yml in /.siriproxy


Usage:

prompt siri and say, what's on channel (whatever).  
Or what's on Fox News or History.  Currently only works for fox news and the history channel. 

The first numeric method works for all channels.



To do:  

1. Fix an issue when 30 minute shows still show up even after they're over
2. Add show description and possibly add episode and channel logo art 
3. Convert more channels to strings.  e.g. what's playing on Spike, rather than what's
   playing on channel 66.
